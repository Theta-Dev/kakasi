# kakasi

`kakasi` is a Rust library to transliterate *hiragana*, *katakana* and *kanji* (Japanese text) into *r≈çmaji* (Latin/Roman alphabet).

It was ported from the [pykakasi](https://codeberg.org/miurahr/pykakasi) library which itself is a port of the original
[kakasi](http://kakasi.namazu.org/) library written in C.
